* 🌙 **Sleek Dark Mode UI:** Dark card borders (`#292524`), clean typography, and zero harsh white outlines.

## 🔄 Real-Time Database Sync Roadmap

To connect this application to a real-time cloud database (e.g. Firebase / Supabase) so all user accounts, study groups, and chat messages synchronize live across multiple devices:

1. **Authentication Sync:** Connect `FirebaseAuth` for email/password and Google Sign-In.
2. **Real-time Study Groups:** Connect `Firebase Realtime Database` or `Cloud Firestore` to sync study group creation, member joins, and admin requests instantly across all devices.
3. **Live Group Chat:** Use `StreamBuilder` connected to Firebase chat collections so messages, file attachments, and typing indicators stream live to all group members.
